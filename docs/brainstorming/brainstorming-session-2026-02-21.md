# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** team
**Date:** 2026-02-21

## Session Overview

**Topic:** AI agent-powered personalized dyslexia accessibility tool for corporate web apps

**Goals:**
- Personalized onboarding agent that interviews users to build a dyslexia accessibility profile
- Real-time HTML rewriting across multiple corporate web apps based on personal profile
- Demonstrate measurable agentic value (time saved, comprehension improved, cognitive load reduced)
- Hackathon-ready prototype using Claude's API for the paid.ai Agentic AI track

### Context Guidance

_Hackathon context: Agentic AI track sponsored by paid.ai. Must build an agent that autonomously completes a meaningful task and proves its value. Prize: €1,000._

### Session Setup

_The team wants to build a Chrome extension (or similar) that uses an AI agent to personalize dyslexia accessibility across corporate web applications. The key differentiator is that the agent conducts an onboarding interview to learn each user's specific needs (shorter sentences, different fonts, simplified vocabulary, color overlays, spacing, reading guides, etc.) and then applies a tailored HTML transformation pipeline in real-time._

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** User-Selected Techniques
**Selected Techniques:**
- SCAMPER Method: Systematic creativity through seven lenses applied to the dyslexia accessibility agent concept

## Technique Execution Results

### SCAMPER Method — 40 Ideas Generated

#### S — SUBSTITUTE (Ideas #1-5)

**[Substitute #1]**: Eye-Tracking Calibration Instead of Self-Reporting
_Concept_: Use webcam eye-tracking during onboarding to infer dyslexia patterns from how the user reads a sample paragraph — where they slow down, re-read, skip.
_Novelty_: Removes self-diagnosis burden; many dyslexic users can't articulate what helps them.

**[Substitute #2]**: Reading Speed Micro-Tests as Onboarding
_Concept_: A/B micro-tests showing the same content formatted two ways, measuring which the user reads faster/more accurately. Agent learns preferences empirically.
_Novelty_: Data-driven personalization instead of subjective self-assessment.

**[Substitute #3]**: Corporate Proxy Layer Instead of Extension
_Concept_: Deploy as corporate proxy/middleware that rewrites HTML before it reaches the browser. IT admins install once, every employee benefits.
_Novelty_: Zero friction for end users; enterprise deployment model.

**[Substitute #4]**: Live Comprehension Feedback Instead of Static Rules
_Concept_: Agent monitors reading behavior (scroll speed, time-on-page, mouse tracking) and adjusts in real-time per paragraph.
_Novelty_: Adaptive within a single session, not just across sessions.

**[Substitute #5]**: Audio Layering Instead of Text-Only
_Concept_: Inline audio companion — hover to hear content read aloud with emphasis based on profile.
_Novelty_: Multi-modal accessibility, not just visual transformation.

#### C — COMBINE (Ideas #6-10)

**[Combine #6]**: Dyslexia Profile + Meeting Summarizer
_Concept_: Agent reformats AND generates personalized TL;DR summaries of long threads, formatted for the user's reading profile.
_Novelty_: Addresses information overload AND readability simultaneously.

**[Combine #7]**: Accessibility + Writing Assistant
_Concept_: Bidirectional — helps dyslexic users both consume and produce accessible content.
_Novelty_: Reading + writing accessibility in one tool.

**[Combine #8]**: Profile + Team Awareness Dashboard
_Concept_: Anonymized team-level dashboard showing aggregate accessibility needs, nudging the org toward accessible communication.
_Novelty_: Shifts from individual accommodation to organizational culture change.

**[Combine #9]**: Dyslexia Agent + Cognitive Load Monitor ⭐ TEAM FAVORITE
_Concept_: Combine with cognitive load tracker (time of day, meeting count, fatigue). Agent adjusts more aggressively at 4pm Friday than 9am Monday.
_Novelty_: Context-aware accessibility adapting to current cognitive state, not just baseline profile.

**[Combine #10]**: Chrome Extension + Slack Bot (Passive + Active)
_Concept_: Passive auto-rewrite plus active on-demand bot: "Rewrite this for me," "Summarize this thread."
_Novelty_: Both passive and active modes in one product.

#### A — ADAPT (Ideas #11-15)

**[Adapt #11]**: Duolingo-Style Gamified Onboarding
_Concept_: Short gamified exercises for onboarding — "Which version is easier to read? Tap!" with progress bars.
_Novelty_: Transforms stigmatizing onboarding into enjoyable experience.

**[Adapt #12]**: Spotify Recommendation Engine for Readability
_Concept_: Evolving "readability profile" that refines from implicit feedback — never asks for configuration after onboarding.
_Novelty_: Silent, continuous learning.

**[Adapt #13]**: Screen Reader Patterns for Sighted Users
_Concept_: Visual navigation breadcrumbs, section structure highlights, collapsible blocks borrowed from blind accessibility.
_Novelty_: Cross-pollinates blind accessibility concepts for dyslexic users.

**[Adapt #14]**: Grammarly-Style Inline Overlay
_Concept_: Contextual floating toolbar offering one-click "Simplify" or "Reformat" when hard content detected.
_Novelty_: User stays in control; transformations offered, not forced.

**[Adapt #15]**: Dark Mode Toggle UX Pattern
_Concept_: One-click toggle between "original view" and "my accessible view" using familiar interaction pattern.
_Novelty_: Zero learning curve — leverages existing mental model.

#### M — MODIFY (Ideas #16-20)

**[Modify #16]**: Semantic Sentence Rewriting (Not Just CSS)
_Concept_: Agent rewrites content — breaking complex sentences, replacing jargon, restructuring into bullets — while preserving meaning.
_Novelty_: Deep semantic transformation, not surface-level formatting.

**[Modify #17]**: Intensity Dial (Minimal to Maximum)
_Concept_: Simple slider from light touch (font/spacing only) to full rewriting. Agent suggests level based on patterns.
_Novelty_: Acknowledges dyslexia impact varies day to day.

**[Modify #18]**: Color Coding Per Content Type
_Concept_: Different color overlays per app/content type — creating visual context cues for task switching.
_Novelty_: Color as semantic navigation aid.

**[Modify #19]**: Information Hierarchy Restructuring
_Concept_: Agent restructures visual hierarchy — enlarging action items, dimming noise, adding weight to deadlines and @mentions.
_Novelty_: Modifies entire page experience, not just text.

**[Modify #20]**: Progressive Disclosure Chunking
_Concept_: Long documents auto-chunked into progressive sections with "Continue reading..." gates.
_Novelty_: Controls information flow, not just appearance.

#### P — PUT TO OTHER USES (Ideas #21-25)

**[Put #21]**: ESL / Non-Native Speaker Mode
_Concept_: Same engine serves non-native English speakers — simplify jargon, shorten sentences, add definitions.
_Novelty_: Expands addressable market without changing core tech.

**[Put #22]**: ADHD Accessibility Mode
_Concept_: Different transformations for ADHD — highlight actions, strip distractions, bold deadlines. Same pipeline, different profile.
_Novelty_: Multi-neurodiverse platform from same architecture.

**[Put #23]**: Communication Quality Checker (Flip for Writers)
_Concept_: "Before you send this, here's how it looks to someone with dyslexia." Becomes org-wide communication tool.
_Novelty_: Repositions from accommodation to communication excellence — removes stigma.

**[Put #24]**: Standalone Accessibility Assessment Product
_Concept_: The onboarding agent itself becomes a product — digital accessibility assessment for all employees.
_Novelty_: Onboarding becomes the product, not just a feature.

**[Put #25]**: Training Data for Accessible Content Guidelines
_Concept_: Export transformation rules as org-wide guidelines. "Based on 10,000 profiles, here are the top 10 ways to write accessibly."
_Novelty_: Data play — agent generates a knowledge asset.

#### E — ELIMINATE (Ideas #26-30)

**[Eliminate #26]**: Eliminate Self-Disclosure / Destigmatize
_Concept_: Frame as "reading optimization" — no labels, no diagnosis required, no HR involvement.
_Novelty_: Destigmatizes completely by removing dyslexia framing from user-facing product.

**[Eliminate #27]**: Eliminate Configuration Entirely
_Concept_: Zero settings. Agent observes behavior for one week, builds profile silently. It just works.
_Novelty_: Radical simplicity — best UX is no UX.

**[Eliminate #28]**: Eliminate Extension — API-Only Platform
_Concept_: API that corporate apps integrate directly. The accessibility layer becomes invisible infrastructure.
_Novelty_: Platform play rather than end-user tool.

**[Eliminate #29]**: Eliminate Visual-Only Approach
_Concept_: Add haptic feedback, audio cues, spatial audio — break out of screen-only transformations.
_Novelty_: Multi-sensory accessibility.

**[Eliminate #30]**: Eliminate One-Profile Assumption
_Concept_: Multiple context profiles — "reading Slack" profile vs "reading docs" profile vs "reading email" profile.
_Novelty_: Acknowledges dyslexia manifests differently by context.

#### R — REVERSE (Ideas #31-35)

**[Reverse #31]**: Make Content Creators Adapt (Upstream Fix)
_Concept_: Coach writers in real-time: "This sentence is too complex for 30% of your audience. Simplify?"
_Novelty_: Prevention over accommodation — fix the source.

**[Reverse #32]**: Start with Max Accessibility, Dial Back
_Concept_: Every new user starts at maximum accessibility, gradually reduced. Opt-out instead of opt-in.
_Novelty_: Ensures no one falls through the cracks.

**[Reverse #33]**: Measure Content Previously Skipped (Value Proof)
_Concept_: "Before the agent, you missed 40% of Slack messages. Now you read 95%." Engagement recovery metric.
_Novelty_: Compelling ROI story for paid.ai track — proves value through engagement, not speed.

**[Reverse #34]**: User Trains the AI (Feedback Loop)
_Concept_: User explicitly teaches the agent: "I hate this formatting. Show me something else." Rapid feedback builds ownership.
_Novelty_: Empowers the user rather than assessing them.

**[Reverse #35]**: Universal Accessible Design by Default
_Concept_: Agent scans ALL outgoing company content and rewrites before anyone sees it.
_Novelty_: Universal design — benefits everyone, not just diagnosed users.

#### Architecture Ideas (Ideas #36-40)

**[Architecture #36]**: Rails Service Object as Agent Brain
_Concept_: `DyslexiaTransformAgent` service orchestrates: receive HTML → extract text → classify → select rules from profile → call Claude → inject transformed HTML. Each step traceable.
_Novelty_: Pure Rails patterns, no framework bloat.

**[Architecture #37]**: Tool Functions as Discrete Services
_Concept_: `TextSimplifier`, `SentenceSplitter`, `JargonReplacer`, `ReadabilityScorer`, `ProfileMatcher` — each a service object. LangSmith traces each individually.
_Novelty_: Modular, testable, cost-visible per tool.

**[Architecture #38]**: Profile as JSON Schema
_Concept_: Structured JSON in DB: `{ sentence_length: "short", font: "opendyslexic", overlay: "#fdf6e3", simplify_jargon: true, bullet_points: true }`. Onboarding agent builds it. Claude transforms according to it.
_Novelty_: Clean separation between user needs and transformation logic.

**[Architecture #39]**: LangSmith as Value Proof Engine
_Concept_: Every transformation traced. Query LangSmith API for dashboard: "847 messages transformed today at $0.003/msg, saving 2.1 hours."
_Novelty_: Don't build value tracking — LangSmith IS value tracking.

**[Architecture #40]**: Onboarding as Conversational Endpoint
_Concept_: `/api/onboarding` backed by `OnboardingAgent` service. Claude conducts conversation AND extracts structured profile data via tool_use. 3-5 turns → complete profile.
_Novelty_: Claude does double duty — conversation + structured extraction.

## Locked Architecture

```
User ←→ Rails App ←→ Chrome Extension (or web demo)
              │
              ├── OnboardingAgent (service object)
              │     └── Claude API (conversational + tool_use)
              │
              ├── TransformAgent (service object)
              │     ├── TextSimplifier (tool)
              │     ├── SentenceSplitter (tool)
              │     ├── ReadabilityScorer (tool)
              │     └── Claude API (semantic rewriting)
              │
              ├── UserProfile (model, JSON schema)
              │
              └── LangSmith (tracing all runs)
                    └── Value Dashboard (query LangSmith API)
```

**Tech Stack:**
- Ruby on Rails — agent logic as service objects + tool functions
- Claude API — LLM engine for semantic text transformation
- LangSmith tracing — via langsmithrb_rails gem (or REST API / OpenTelemetry)
- Chrome Extension or web demo — frontend delivery

### Creative Facilitation Narrative

_The team arrived with a clear vision — an AI accessibility tool for dyslexia in corporate environments — and quickly zeroed in on what makes it unique: personalized, profile-driven transformation rather than one-size-fits-all. SCAMPER pushed the concept through all seven lenses, generating 40 ideas. The standout moment was Combine #9 (cognitive load monitoring), which the team flagged as a future differentiator. The session converged on a clean Rails + Claude + LangSmith architecture with the value proof baked into the tracing layer itself._

## Idea Organization and Prioritization

### Thematic Organization

**Theme 1: Onboarding & Profile Building** — _How the agent learns what each user needs_
- #2 A/B micro-tests for onboarding (empirical learning)
- #11 Duolingo-style gamified onboarding (destigmatize)
- #26 Eliminate self-disclosure — frame as "reading optimization"
- #32 Start with max accessibility, dial back (opt-out model)
- #34 User trains the AI via feedback loop
- #38 Profile as JSON schema in DB
- #40 Onboarding as conversational endpoint with Claude tool_use

**Theme 2: Core Transformation Engine** — _What the agent does to content_
- #16 Semantic sentence rewriting (the differentiator)
- #17 Intensity dial (minimal to maximum)
- #19 Information hierarchy restructuring
- #20 Progressive disclosure chunking
- #30 Multiple context profiles per app
- #36 Rails service object as agent brain
- #37 Discrete tool functions (TextSimplifier, SentenceSplitter, etc.)

**Theme 3: Value Proof & Agent Economics** — _How to win the paid.ai track_
- #33 Measure content previously skipped (engagement recovery)
- #39 LangSmith as the value proof engine
- #8 Team awareness dashboard
- #25 Export transformation insights as guidelines

**Theme 4: Future Expansion (Post-Hackathon)** — _Pitch but don't build_
- #9 Cognitive load monitor (team favorite)
- #21 ESL / non-native speaker mode
- #22 ADHD accessibility mode
- #23 Communication quality checker for writers
- #7 Bidirectional reading + writing assistant

### Prioritization Results

**Must Build (Hackathon Core):**

1. **OnboardingAgent + UserProfile (JSON)** — The personalization story IS the product
2. **TransformAgent with Claude semantic rewriting** — Core value, real text transformation not CSS
3. **LangSmith tracing on all runs** — Value proof for paid.ai track, free analytics
4. **Simple web demo page (fake Slack/Teams UI)** — Easier to demo than a real Chrome extension

### Action Plans

#### 1. OnboardingAgent + UserProfile

**What:** Conversational AI onboarding that builds a structured accessibility profile
**Rails Implementation:**
- `OnboardingAgent` service object calling Claude API with tool_use
- `UserProfile` model with JSON column for accessibility preferences
- `/api/onboarding` endpoint — 3-5 conversational turns to complete profile
- Profile schema: `{ sentence_length, font_preference, color_overlay, simplify_jargon, bullet_points, max_paragraph_length, line_spacing, highlight_keywords }`

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Frame as "reading optimization" not "dyslexia tool" (Idea #26)
- Gamified A/B micro-tests where possible (Idea #2 + #11)
- User feedback loop to refine profile over time (Idea #34)

#### 2. TransformAgent with Claude Semantic Rewriting

**What:** Agent receives HTML, extracts text, transforms it per user profile, returns modified HTML
**Rails Implementation:**
- `TransformAgent` service orchestrating tool pipeline
- Tool services: `TextSimplifier`, `SentenceSplitter`, `ReadabilityScorer`
- Claude API call with user profile embedded in system prompt
- Returns transformed HTML preserving original structure

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Semantic rewriting, not just CSS (Idea #16)
- Modular tools for traceability (Idea #37)
- Profile-driven transformation rules (Idea #38)

#### 3. LangSmith Tracing

**What:** Full observability on every agent run
**Rails Implementation:**
- `langsmithrb_rails` gem (or REST API / OpenTelemetry fallback)
- Trace every onboarding conversation and transformation
- Tag runs with metadata: user_id, content_type, transformation_count
- Query LangSmith API for value dashboard data

**Key Design Decisions:**
- LangSmith IS the value proof — don't rebuild analytics (Idea #39)
- Track cost per transformation, latency, token usage
- Demo metric: "X messages transformed at $Y/msg, saving Z hours"

#### 4. Web Demo Page

**What:** Simple page simulating corporate messaging UI with before/after toggle
**Implementation:**
- Static HTML page styled like Slack/Teams
- Paste or load sample corporate messages
- "Transform" button calls TransformAgent API
- Side-by-side or toggle view: original vs. accessible version
- Value metrics displayed: cost, time, readability score improvement

## Session Summary and Insights

**Key Achievements:**
- 40 ideas generated across all 7 SCAMPER lenses
- Clear architecture locked: Rails + Claude API + LangSmith
- 4 actionable build items prioritized for hackathon scope
- Future expansion roadmap identified for pitch narrative

**Killer Hackathon Pitch Points:**
1. "Users went from reading 60% of Slack messages to 95%" (Idea #33)
2. Every transformation costs $0.003 and saves 45 seconds (LangSmith proves it)
3. No diagnosis required — it's "reading optimization for everyone" (Idea #26)
4. Future: ADHD, ESL, cognitive load monitoring — same architecture, different profiles
